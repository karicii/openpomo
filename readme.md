# OpenPomo

OpenPomo is a simple and open-source Pomodoro timer built to help you stay focused.  
The goal is to provide a distraction-free tool that is easy to use while still giving useful feedback.

##  Purpose
- **Straightforward**: No clutter, just start the timer and get to work.  
- **Helpful**: Desktop notifications let you know when it’s time for a break or to get back to focus.  
- **Stats**: Keep track of how many Pomodoros you’ve completed.  
- **Cross-platform**: Works in any modern browser and can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).  

##  Features
- Default 25/5/15 Pomodoro cycle (focus, short break, long break)  
- Automatic switching between work and break sessions  
- Browser notifications when a session ends  
- Simple stats view to see your progress  
- PWA support so you can “install” it on desktop or mobile
